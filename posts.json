I could not leave my house for over a year because I was so ashamed. It took me a year to recover. \n\nWhen I was 6 I told myself, “this is the way I want to feel for the rest of my life,” happy. I can remember it like it was yesterday.\n\nSo if you’re ever down on your luck, I know how it feels, so feel free to give me a call, you will be surprised by how I was healed in one day! \n\nAfter that experience I learned how to stay happy, well 95% of every day. \n\nJohn Kimball, Owner of Sun Electronics Int., Inc. \n305-498-1863\nCall me any time day or night, 24/365 days a year!\n\nLife can be beautiful ! \n\n\n\n"

    "content": "I have just come back from inspecting 120,000 solar panels . I left Thursday night and yesterday I got up at 6 am and prepared to be picked up and taken to inspect 120,000 540 and 545 watt solar panels . I had been there once before for 5 days hoping to inspect them but the permission to look at them never came even though I was told I could. My partner Paul and his two partners were very interested in putting them on Paul’s ranch in the desert of California . It was a great idea I thought. \n\nPail got frustraded and at 85 decided to drive 1,000 miles to view the panels actually they correct word is modules. He was 85 ! The trip and other things killed him. after not being allowed to see the modules he returned by car to California desert ranch . Within days he passed away. "

    "content": "Call me if you’re interested 14 cents a watt. 545 watts. Brand new! 30 yr. Warranty. or make me an offer. \n\nI’m thinking about that last big shipment of mine. it worked out great . We won a contest and we got 80 containers from Amsterdam . You put a deposit down of 10 per cent but one we won you sent the other 90% . Then you would get any number of modules you wanted but that won’t be happening this time. You have to order by the pallet otherwise it would be a nightmare ! Been there , done that , won’t go that again. you see some guy called me before the auction and said something like this: you aren’t fair , you won’t let people buy those modules in quantities less than a pallet. Some of us can’t afford to get a whole pallet. So I said it’s ok you can buy less than a pallet. I wanted to let everyone get in on the auction. It was a shipping nightmare. Live and learn !\n\nSo you have to buy a whole pallet . As soon as we have collected the money for every single pallet about 3,750 pallets we will let you come to the warehouse and pick up your pallets or truck loads.\n\njohn\n305 498 1863"
