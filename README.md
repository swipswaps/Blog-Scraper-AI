## 🚀 How It Works

### Architecture

1. **Feed Discovery**: The app first attempts to find a JSON Feed at `/f.json` (common for GoDaddy blogs)
2. **Post Enumeration**: Extracts post metadata (title, URL, date) from the feed
3. **Content Fetching**: Visits each individual post URL to fetch full content
4. **Smart Parsing**:
   - Extracts content from `window._BLOG_DATA` JavaScript object (GoDaddy structure)
   - Parses Draft.js JSON format to get clean text content
   - Falls back to DOM parsing if JavaScript extraction fails
5. **Data Processing**: Filters, sorts, and displays posts with search functionality

### Supported Blog Platforms

- **GoDaddy Website Builder** (Primary support with JSON Feed)
- Any blog with JSON Feed format (`/f.json`)
- Generic blogs (with limited support via DOM parsing)

### Content Extraction Strategy

The scraper uses a multi-layered approach:

1. **JSON Feed** (`/f.json`): Discovers all posts and their URLs
2. **JavaScript Data Extraction**: Parses `window._BLOG_DATA.post.fullContent` from each post page
3. **Draft.js Parser**: Extracts text from Draft.js content blocks
4. **DOM Fallback**: Uses CSS selectors (`[data-ux="BlogPostContent"]`, `article`, etc.) if JavaScript parsing fails
5. **Feed Excerpt**: Uses HTML content from feed as last resort

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher recommended)
- **npm** or **yarn**

**Don't have these?** The `setup-wizard.sh` script will help you!

## 🛠️ Installation

### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended) ⭐

**For first-time users:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/swipswaps/Blog-Scraper-AI.git
cd Blog-Scraper-AI
./setup-wizard.sh
```

The wizard will:
- ✅ Check system requirements
- ✅ Install dependencies
- ✅ Test the app locally
- ✅ Optionally deploy

### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/swipswaps/Blog-Scraper-AI.git
   cd Blog-Scraper-AI
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**:
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## 📖 User Guide

### Basic Usage

1. **Enter Blog URL**:
   - Paste the blog homepage URL (e.g., `https://johnssolarblog.com/`)
   - The app will automatically detect the JSON feed if available

2. **Set Post Limit** (Optional):
   - Enter the maximum number of posts to fetch
   - Leave empty to fetch all available posts

3. **Click "Fetch Posts"**:
   - Watch real-time progress as posts are discovered and fetched
   - Each post's content is extracted individually

4. **Browse Results**:
   - Posts appear in an accordion list (5 per page)
   - Click on a post to expand and read full content
   - Use pagination controls to navigate through posts

5. **Search & Filter**:
   - Use the search box to filter posts by title or content
   - Results update in real-time as you type

6. **Sort Posts**:
   - Sort by title (A-Z or Z-A)
   - Sort by content length (shortest to longest or vice versa)

7. **Export Data**:
   - **Download CSV**: Get a spreadsheet-compatible file
   - **Download JSON**: Get structured data for further processing

### Example Workflow

```
1. Enter URL: https://johnssolarblog.com/
2. Set limit: 10
3. Click "Fetch Posts"
4. Wait for scraping to complete (progress shown)
5. Search for "solar panels"
6. Sort by "Title (A-Z)"
7. Click "Download CSV" to export results
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Tech Stack

- **React 19**: Modern UI framework
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and dev server
- **CSS**: Custom styling with responsive design

### Key Components

- **`App.tsx`**: Main application component with state management
- **`PostList.tsx`**: Post display with accordion, pagination, and search
- **`geminiService.ts`**: Core scraping logic with feed discovery and content extraction
- **`proxyService.ts`**: CORS proxy handling with multiple fallback services

### CORS Proxy Services

The app uses multiple proxy services with automatic fallback:

1. `https://api.allorigins.win/raw?url=`
2. `https://corsproxy.io/?`
3. `https://api.codetabs.com/v1/proxy?quest=`
4. `https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/`

### Data Structure

**Post Object**:
```typescript
interface Post {
  title: string;      // Post title
  content: string;    // Full post content (plain text)
}
```

**Export Formats**:
- **CSV**: `title,content` with proper escaping
- **JSON**: Array of post objects

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Content Migration**: Export blog posts for migration to another platform
- **Content Analysis**: Analyze blog content, word counts, topics
- **Backup**: Create backups of blog content
- **Research**: Collect and analyze blog posts for research purposes
- **SEO Analysis**: Export content for SEO tools and analysis

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Failed to fetch posts"
- Check if the blog URL is correct and accessible
- Verify the blog has a JSON feed at `/f.json`
- Try a different CORS proxy (automatic fallback should handle this)

### "Content not available"
- The blog structure may not be supported
- Try a GoDaddy Website Builder blog for best results

### Slow Performance
- Reduce the post limit to fetch fewer posts
- The app fetches each post individually for full content (intentional for accuracy)

## 🌐 Deployment

### 🚀 Automated Deployment (Easiest)

**Interactive deployment with guided setup:**
```bash
./deploy.sh
```

This script will:
- ✅ Check dependencies and install if needed
- ✅ Build your project automatically
